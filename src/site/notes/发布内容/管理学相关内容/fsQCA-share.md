# 定义
**fsQCA**（**Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis**）是一种用于社会科学和管理研究的定性比较分析方法。它是基于QCA（Qualitative Comparative Analysis）方法发展而来，特别适用于研究复杂的因果关系和多重条件组合的情境。
# 特点
## 模糊集理论（Fuzzy Set Theory）
在fsQCA中，变量的取值不是简单的二值（是/否），而是可以介于0和1之间，代表不同程度的隶属关系。这使得fsQCA比传统的QCA方法更加灵活，能够处理连续变量和更复杂的因果关系。
## 条件组合
fsQCA强调通过识别并分析条件组合来理解因果关系。它能够帮助研究者找到多个条件组合如何共同作用，导致特定结果的发生。
## 多重因果关系
fsQCA适用于那些因果关系不是简单单一的情况，特别适合处理多重因果条件的场景。在这种方法中，多个变量或条件可能共同作用，影响结果的发生。
## 案例的定性分析
fsQCA不仅关注单一条件对结果的影响，还关注不同条件组合如何共同影响结果，因此它侧重于对案例的定性分析，强调不同条件组合下的比较。通过对条件组合进行最小化，fsQCA旨在找出可能的最简洁的因果路径，从而提供更为简洁且有解释力的因果理论。
# 软件操作和相关步骤
## 数据校准
### 3个锚点
模糊隶属分数1代表“完全隶属于某一集合
隶属分数0代表“完全不隶属于某集合
0.5分数也是最大模糊点，它指评估案例是否属于或者不隶属于一个集合时的最大模糊点。
### 常见的校准标准
#### 1-分位数(95%，50%，5%:75%，50%，25%）
获得25% 50% 75%分位点
```python
import pandas as pd

# 读取Excel文件
file_path = 'data.xlsx'  # 请确保文件路径正确
data = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# 指定需要进行校准的列
columns_to_calibrate = ['Out', 'P', 'R', 'M', 'E', 'T']  # 请替换为实际列名

# 计算指定列的分位点并打印
for column in columns_to_calibrate:
    if column in data.columns:
        q25 = data[column].quantile(0.25)
        q50 = data[column].quantile(0.50)
        q75 = data[column].quantile(0.75)

        print(f"列 {column} 的分位点:")
        print(f"25% 分位点: {q25}")
        print(f"50% 分位点 (中位数): {q50}")
        print(f"75% 分位点: {q75}")
        print("\n")
    else:
        print(f"列 {column} 不在数据中")
```
`
结果如下：

```CMD
列 Out 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 0.386248317529488
50% 分位点 (中位数): 0.436729004236586
75% 分位点: 0.504219610289015

列 P 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 25.0
50% 分位点 (中位数): 39.0
75% 分位点: 61.0

列 R 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 1476.0
50% 分位点 (中位数): 2468.0
75% 分位点: 4723.0

列 M 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 2.83239533191123
50% 分位点 (中位数): 3.58364852903886
75% 分位点: 4.90875980083533

列 E 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 24966636.4
50% 分位点 (中位数): 54836998.0
75% 分位点: 103515648.8

列 T 的分位点:
25% 分位点: 333626.650115624
50% 分位点 (中位数): 945411.358160573
75% 分位点: 2285777.65893681
```

之后在fsQCA软件中进行,点击File-Open打开csv文件
![Attachments/fsQCA-share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219140212490.png](/img/user/%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9/%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E5%86%85%E5%AE%B9/Attachments/fsQCA-share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219140212490.png)
使用变量计算工具进行数据校准
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848470.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848470.png]]
依次对待分析变量进行校准，直至所有变量完成校准。
#### 2-实际含义(比如国际通用标准) 
具体研究有着具体的标准。
## 进行必要性检验
使用Analyze-Necessary Conditions进行必要性检验
Outcome指Y（果变量），输入X（变量）时要输入X与~X，代表变量与非变量
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848527.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848527.png]]
结果如下
```CMD
Analysis of Necessary Conditions

Outcome variable: NOut

Conditions tested:
     Consistency    Coverage
NP   0.688053       0.687890
~NP  0.400401       0.396196
NR   0.849452       0.885644
~NR  0.292428       0.278049
NM   0.717125       0.727202
~NM  0.381118       0.371928
NE   0.876872       0.884750
~NE  0.267072       0.261898
NT   0.834179       0.844689
~NT  0.312478       0.305365
```
没有大于0.9的条件，即没有必要条件。之后进行非果变量必要性检测，即输入的Y变为~Y。
结果如下：
```CMD
Analysis of Necessary Conditions

Outcome variable: ~NOut

Conditions tested:
     Consistency    Coverage
NP   0.396336       0.400542
~NP  0.691168       0.691330
NR   0.248862       0.262281
~NR  0.891495       0.856855
NM   0.363318       0.372421
~NM  0.733870       0.723945
NE   0.255396       0.260487
~NE  0.887003       0.879258
NT   0.296815       0.303815
~NT  0.848267       0.837953
```
没有大于0.9的条件，即没有必要条件。
## 真值表分析
使用Analyze-Truth Table Algorithm

这里有一个关键步骤，为了能看到真值表指代哪些年份-省份，需要进行变量编码 这里给出一个很简单的编码形式
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848594.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848594.png]]
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848661.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848661.png]]
可以看到，在真值表中展示这个列，即可快速定位年份-省份。
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848723.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848723.png]]
真值表结果如下：
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848801.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848801.png]]
之后进行重新编码，编码值是默认值软件自动给出。
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848874.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848874.png]]
编码后结果：
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848935.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135848935.png]]
这时想知道真值表中的行对应哪些样本，点击cases即可，可见依据编码形式，可以定位样本。
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135849004.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135849004.png]]
## 路径分析
点击Standard Analyses，因为X中未出现必要性条件，所以全部变量选择Present or Absent
![[Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135849068.png\|Attachments/fsQCA-Share-Attachment/Attachment-20250219135849068.png]]
最终得到结果：
